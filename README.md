#  Java Mastery Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the **60 Day Java Mastery Challenge**! This repository is part of my journey to master Java, both core and advanced topics, over the course of 60 days. I will be learning and coding daily, tackling Java concepts from the basics to more advanced features, and working on projects as I progress.

In parallel, I’m also preparing for SQL mastery to solidify my knowledge of databases and become proficient in both programming and data management. My ultimate goal is to secure a job as a **Software Developer** and apply my skills in the industry.

## Learning Path

### 1. **Core Java**
I will start by mastering the fundamentals of Java, including:
- Variables and Data Types
- Control Flow (if-else, loops)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Arrays and Collections

### 2. **Advanced Java**
Once the basics are covered, I'll dive into advanced topics such as:
- Multithreading and Concurrency
- Java Streams and Lambdas
- Design Patterns
- JavaFX (for GUI applications)
- Network Programming
- JVM Internals

### 3. **Projects**
At the end of the 60 days, I will work on various projects to showcase my learning, including:
- A Java-based application using OOP and data structures
- A project that incorporates multithreading and advanced Java concepts
- Building and consuming APIs

## SQL Mastery

In parallel with the Java challenge, I am preparing for SQL mastery, learning:
- Database design and normalization
- Writing complex SQL queries
- Data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Advanced SQL functions and joins

## Career Goal

By completing this challenge, I aim to:
- Master Java programming
